Update Summary (3)
- adapted OOP structure
- used array of months to get month name from month number
- used string interpolation `${...}` to construct + format in HH:MM:SS and DD/MM/YYYY


How I improved today...
- used prototype + bind method to define methods for constructor instead of directly defining those from an instance (new object)
- useful for multiple instances that share same methods

Next steps...
- fade-in animation w/ css
- add option to switch between 12 HR / 24 HR
- add dark mode / light mode
